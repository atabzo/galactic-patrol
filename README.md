## rough mindmap of what's coming up

scene 1: cinematic opening with storytelling about how the earth is about to be invaded and so + smoothly transitions into a colorful panel putting the world's hope on the userr
scene 2: the user can select between yes or no (with a cute hopeful emoji)
scene 3: the scene fades in with the spaceship leaving the earth and finally entering the space
scene 4: you just destroy the asteroids coming at you HOWEVER! you mustn't hit any planets or that would result in a gravitational disruption eventually ending it all

brainstorm about what to add for score-tracking... maybe something about how you find a new planet to seek help which eventually spirals into a whole new storyline
